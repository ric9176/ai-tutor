### Student's Answer
"Alright, so in this part of 'Macbeth,' we're looking at Lady Macbeth sleepwalking and talking in her sleep. It's pretty intense because she's freaking out about the murders she and Macbeth have been involved in. Like, she keeps trying to wash imaginary blood off her hands and talks about the smell of blood that perfumes can't cover up. This is totally different from how she was earlier in the play. Remember when she was all like, 'We gotta be tough and do what needs to be done'? Now, she's super guilt-ridden and scared.
In the beginning, Lady Macbeth was really ambitious and kind of pushed Macbeth to do all those bad things. She was pretty strong and seemed like she could handle anything. But now, in this scene, she's falling apart. It's like the guilt is too much for her, and she can't deal with what they've done. So, yeah, she's changed a lot. She started off all tough and ended up being overwhelmed by guilt and fear.
Overall, Shakespeare shows Lady Macbeth as someone who goes through a big change. At first, she's all about power and doing whatever it takes to get it. But then, she can't handle the consequences of her actions and totally breaks down. It's kind of a warning about ambition and guilt, I guess. So, I'd say I agree that she changes during the play, and it's a pretty dramatic change too."
### Grading AO1-AO3
| **Assessment Objective** | **Comments** | **Grade** |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | --------- |
| AO1                      | The student has demonstrated a personal response, but the critical style could be developed further. Limited textual references have been used to support interpretations. | 2 |
| AO2                      | Analysis of language is present but lacks depth. The student could have included specific terminology and more detailed examples. | 2 |
| AO3                      | Understanding of text and context is evident; however, explicit connections between Lady Macbeth's development and the wider context of the play are not thoroughly explored. | 2 |
| **Average level across AO1-AO3** | | 2 |\n| **Score:**               | | 6/30 |

### Grading AO4:
